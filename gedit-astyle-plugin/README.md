Gedit AStyle Plugin
===

Gedit plugin for AStyle, a source code formatter.

* Uses the system-wide astyle package to perform its duty.
* Run the included 'install.sh' to install the plugin. Modify if not using apt.
* If Gedit was open during installation you may have to close & reopen it for
 the plugin to show up in the plugin selection window.

Gedit plugin for AStyle, a source code formatter. Became defunct after the move
 to gtk3, I attempted to keep it working but between the non-functional
 preferences menu and gEdit's crappy new UI. I can't recommend it.
